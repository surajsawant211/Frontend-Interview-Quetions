### 2. What are components in React?

**Answer:** Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable and self-contained pieces of code that define how a part of the UI should look and behave. Components can be functional or class-based.

### 3. What is JSX?

**Answer:** JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML elements and components in a JavaScript file. It makes it easier to create and manage React elements.

### 4. What is the difference between a functional component and a class component?

**Answer:** 
- **Functional Component:** A simpler way to define components using functions. They can use hooks for managing state and side effects.
- **Class Component:** Defined using ES6 classes. They have lifecycle methods and are more verbose compared to functional components.

### 5. What is `useState`?

**Answer:** `useState` is a React hook that allows you to add state to functional components. It returns an array with the current state and a function to update it.

### 6. What is `useEffect`?

**Answer:** `useEffect` is a React hook used to perform side effects in functional components. It runs after the component renders and can be used for data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

### 7. What is a prop in React?

**Answer:** Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from parent to child components in React. They allow components to be dynamic and reusable.

### 8. How does React handle state management?

**Answer:** React manages state using hooks like `useState` for local state and libraries like Redux or Context API for global state management. 

### 9. What is React Router?

**Answer:** React Router is a library used for handling routing in React applications. It allows you to define routes and navigate between different views or components.

### 10. What is the purpose of `key` prop in React?

**Answer:** The `key` prop helps React identify which items in a list have changed, been added, or removed. It helps improve the performance of rendering lists by providing a stable identity for each item.

## Advanced React Concepts

### 11. What is React Fiber?

**Answer:** React Fiber is a complete rewrite of the React reconciliation algorithm, introduced to improve rendering performance by enabling incremental rendering and prioritization of updates.

### 12. What is the role of `shouldComponentUpdate`?

**Answer:** `shouldComponentUpdate` is a lifecycle method used in class components to determine whether a component should re-render or not, based on changes in props or state.

### 13. What are React hooks?

**Answer:** Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Examples include `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.

### 14. What is `useContext` and how does it work?

**Answer:** `useContext` is a React hook that allows you to access the value of a Context object. It simplifies accessing context values without needing to use a Context Consumer.

### 15. What is `React.memo`?

**Answer:** `React.memo` is a higher-order component used to optimize functional components by preventing unnecessary re-renders. It performs a shallow comparison of props to determine if the component should re-render.

### 16. What is the purpose of `React.createContext`?

**Answer:** `React.createContext` is used to create a Context object to share values across components without passing props explicitly through every level of the component tree.

### 17. What is the role of `useReducer` hook?

**Answer:** `useReducer` is a React hook used for managing complex state logic in functional components. It is an alternative to `useState` and is useful for handling state transitions based on actions.

### 18. What is `React.StrictMode`?

**Answer:** `React.StrictMode` is a development tool that activates additional checks and warnings to help identify potential problems in an application.

### 19. What is the `useLayoutEffect` hook used for?

**Answer:** `useLayoutEffect` is used to perform side effects that require DOM mutations or measurements immediately after the DOM has been updated but before the browser has painted.

### 20. What is the purpose of `React.lazy`?

**Answer:** `React.lazy` is used to dynamically import components, enabling code splitting and reducing the initial load time of the application.

## Code Splitting and Suspense

### 21. What is code splitting?

const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <LazyComponent />
      </React.Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 23. What is React Suspense?

**Answer:** React Suspense is a feature that allows you to handle the loading state of asynchronous components by providing a fallback UI while the component is being loaded.

### 24. How do you use Suspense for data fetching?

**Answer:** React Suspense for data fetching is experimental. You would wrap components that perform data fetching with `<Suspense>` and provide a fallback UI.

### 25. What is the difference between `React.Suspense` and `React.lazy`?

**Answer:** 
- **`React.Suspense`:** Provides a fallback UI while waiting for a lazy-loaded component to be ready.
- **`React.lazy`:** Used to dynamically import components, enabling code splitting.

## Chunking

## Routing and Navigation

### 51. How do you implement route guards in React Router?

**Answer:** Implement route guards by creating higher-order components or custom route components that check authentication or authorization before rendering protected routes.
``` jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';

const withAuth = (Component) => {
  return (props) => {
    const isAuthenticated = // your auth logic here;
    return isAuthenticated ? <Component {...props} /> : <Navigate to="/login" />;
  };
};

const ProtectedRoute = withAuth(SomeComponent);

export default ProtectedRoute;
```

  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleClick = () => {
    navigate('/new-path');
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to new path</button>;
};
```

### 54. What are `Route` and `Switch` components in React Router?

**Answer:** 
- **`Route`:** Defines a mapping between a URL path and a component that should be rendered.
- **`Switch`:** Renders the first child `<Route>` or `<Redirect>` that matches the current location.

``` jsx
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

const App = () => (
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
    <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
  </Routes>
);
```

### 55. How do you implement nested routing in React Router?

**Answer:** Implement nested routing by defining child routes within parent routes. Use the `Route` component to specify the child routes inside a parent route’s component.

``` jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Routes, Route, Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';

const Dashboard = () => (
  <div>
    <h2>Dashboard</h2>
    <Outlet />
  </div>
);

const DashboardHome = () => <div>Dashboard Home</div>;
const Settings = () => <div>Settings</div>;

const App = () => (
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
    <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />}>
      <Route path="home" element={<DashboardHome />} />
      <Route path="settings" element={<Settings />} />
    </Route>
    <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
  </Routes>
);

```
#### In this example, the Dashboard component includes an <Outlet> where the nested routes (/dashboard/home and /dashboard/settings) will be rendered.
